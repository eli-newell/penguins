## Single trait distribution
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(penguins) +  
  geom_histogram(position = "identity", mapping = aes(fill = species, x = bill_length_mm), alpha = 0.5)+
  labs(
    caption = "Bill length distribution by species.",
    x = "Bill length (mm)",
    y = "Count",
    fill = "Species")+
  theme_minimal()

```
